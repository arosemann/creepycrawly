# Creepy Crawly

Creepy Crawly is a rather simple financial analytics tool for exchange traded assets. 
It collects various parameters for a given product. The data is kept in a database. 
Based on the collected data a user can define financial events. When such an event occurs, it can trigger tasks that, 
for example, notify a person about a certain market condition.
